541 years ago, "Lotus", planet that we live in was presumably colonized by our ancestors, well at least according to AI that was left with us. We were first generation of humans, who were taught mainly by machines due to unknown to us reasons.
Machines were programmed to give all us knowledge they posses. We became immortal, got all knowledge that made our standard of live excellent We also got knowledge how to travel in our space system considerably fast. Yet there was not even one piece of information about traveling between space systems, no design of ships, no engines. Nothing. 
We determined that our planet is orbiting around White Dwarf, which we call Orion. About 150 years ago our scientists noticed very small change of temperature on Lotus.
It was confirmed that Orion's temperature has dropped by 50 degree Celsius. Even with all our knowledge we do not know much about cosmos. We did not know whether it was sign of Orion burning out.
So we decided to start project which would allow us to built engines able to enter hyperspace in order to traverse other space systems. We still had hope, that Orion was not burning out.
45 years ago temperature of Orion has been confirmed to drop by another 105 degrees. If our calculations are correct our planet won't be able to sustain life by year 1023. Even if we won't die by old age, we won't be able to survive in that temperature.
Finally 2 years ago we managed to build prototype of hyperdrive, that should be able to travel hyperspace.
As of current year 541, space habitat at the edge of our system that would allow us to traverse systems was built.
Your mission as Admiral is to train pilots and find us a habitable planet. Keep in mind that we could only built 4 hyperdrives due to need of specific minerals. We will send you more information about that mineral. One of pilots priorities should be looking for such minerals in systems that they will explore.
Good luck. End of transmission.
