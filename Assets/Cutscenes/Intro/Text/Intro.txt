541 years ago we colonzied "Lotus". First generation never met our predecessors. We were taught by AI. Most of our technology is based on knowledge we gained from them. 
Immortality, near utopian standard of living and ability to freely travel in our solar system - that's just a small part of given to us knowledge. 
It was clear that civilization which sent us here was advanced beyond our comprehension.

Our planet orbits around White Dwarf, which we call "Orion".
About 150 years ago our scientists noticed small change of temperature on Lotus.
It was confirmed that Orion temperature has dropped noticeably. It was clear that Orion is burning out.
At that point our people started question whether we were brought there by our ancestors.

Currently two main theories are circulating about our reason of being here. First one is called "Virtual reality theory" and assumes that we play some kind of virtual reality game.
Second one is called "Alien experiment theory". It assumes that we are part of experiment conducted by advanced alien civilization.

At the time we ignored those theories, as we had to start project which would allow us to built engines able to enter hyperspace and traverse to other solar systems.
It took us 148 years to make first fully functional hyperdrive.

As of current year 541, space habitat from which you can send pilots to explore solar systems was built. Your mission as Admiral is to train pilots and find us habitable planet. 
Keep in mind that we could only built 4 hyperdrives due to need of mineral we call "Quame". One of pilots priorities during explorations should be looking for such mineral.

If we won't find habitable planet before year 1023 temperature of Orion will be too low to sustain life on Lotus. It will mark end of our civilization.

Good luck. End of transmission.
