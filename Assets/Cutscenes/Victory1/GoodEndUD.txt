Excellent job. Thanks to your immeasurable contribution our future is secured. 
We learned one very important lesson from this - even immortal flesh is weak. 
We will now focus on enhancing our kind. Just think about all of the possibilites.
We could probably even use Quame to modify our bodies and travel through hyperspace without any vehicles if we do so.
Once again, amazing job. End of transmission.
