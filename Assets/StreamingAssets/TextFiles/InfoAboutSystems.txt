Systems have 5 possible threat levels:
Very Low - Expected total power of 600
Low - Expected total power of 1200
Medium - Expected total power of 2000
High - Expected total power of 4000
Lethal - Expected total power of 8000
[Total power] is random value between 50% and 150% of expected total power ( fe. Medium threat level will have actual power between 1000 and 3000)
[Power] is sum of stat of the entity * weigth ([Ordinary] pilots at level 1 and WITHOUT any equipment will have around 600 power)
Higher threat level means better reward for successful exploration and higher chance to find habitable planet ( which at this moment is objective for winning game )
Chance to find habitable planet is equal to:
Very low - -10% + 1% ppse ( up to 20% )
Low - 0% +1% ppse ( up to 40% )
Medium - 0% + 2% ppse ( up to 60% )
High - 3% + 3% ppse ( up to 100% )
Lethal - 15% + 4% ppse ( up to 100% )
[ppse] - per previous successful exploration ( stackable , fe. if player has done 5 successful exploration his chance to find habitable planet will be equal to 5% on [Low] threat level and equal to 35% on [Lethal] level
[ppse] is sum of explorations regardless of difficulty
Player can send up to 4 pilots on one exploration. ( sending one pilot on mission means using 1 hyperdrive )
If all ships are destroyed in battle, pilots will be deleted from pool of recruited (dead) and hyperdrives will be lost
If any of the ships survive, all pilots are considered alive, exploration is marked as successful and nothing is lost. 
Rewards are random and multiplied by threat level.
Mulitplier is:
Very low - 1* for nulls and metals, 0.3* titan v2, 0.1* Quame, 0.3* encre 
Low - 1* for nulls and metals, 0.5* titan v2, 0.2* Quame, 0.5* encre 
Medium - 1.5* for nulls and metals, 1* titan v2, 0.5* Quame, 1* encre 
High - 2* for nulls and metals, 2* titan v2, 1* Quame, 2* encre 
Lethal - 3* for nulls and metals, 5* titan v2, 2* Quame, 5* encre 

Random values of rewards ( pre modifier ) = 
Nulls - ( 20 000 - 80 000 )
Metals - ( 800 - 2 000 )
Titan - ( 200 - 400 )
Encre - ( 200 - 400 )
Quame - ( 100 - 200 )

System threat is assigned based on equation :
((x-541)/500+0.15)*y
where:
x is current year in game
y is random number between 0 and 9
Based on rolled number (int, rounded down) threat level is assigned:
0 - Very low
1 - Low
2 - Medium
3 - High
4+ - Lethal

Exploration time is random between 5 to 25 years ( this may and probably will be changed )
